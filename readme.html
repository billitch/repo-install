    <h1>Repo-install: An ASDF-install replacement geared towards collaboration</h1>

    Repo-install is a common lisp package manager that can be used to chase down and download dependencies between common lisp packages. Unlike other package managers (asdf-install, mudballs), repo-install
    maintains the connection between source code on your disk, and the upstream repository.

    <p> In cases where the upstream package is stored in a distributed revision control system, the local files are stored in the same DVC system as a clone.
    <p> When the upstream package is not a DVC, repo-install will create a local DVC repository with the non-DVC distribution system (tarballs, cvs, or svn), as input to the local repository.

    <p>There are two primary advantages to this: 
      <ul>
	<li>Changes you make to your local copy of the package remain in place (ie are rebased) even when you update to a newer version of the package.
	<li>It is much easier to submit patches to the upstream maintainer. For DVC, it is also much easier for the upstream maintainer to integrate your patches.
      </ul>

    <p>Both of these capabilities are particularly important when working on common-lisp. Several very useful packages are maintained on a part-time or hobbyist attention level. You may need to maintain your local patches for weeks to ... forever if the upstream maintainer doesn't have the cycles to integrate them sooner.

      Repo-install's goal is to simplify collaboration between the users and the maintainers of lisp packages

      
      <h2>Installing</h2>

      Repo-install is bootstrapped using a tarball that can be found at <a href="foo">http://www.machineinsight.com/repo-install/repo-install-bootstrap.tgz</a>. Uninstall to a convienient location and add the following to your lisp initialization file.

    <p>
      <pre>
(load "<i>&lt;location where you unzipped the bootstrap tarball&gt;</i>/boot.lisp")
      </pre>

    <p>You will also need have <a href="Git">Git</a>, <a href="bzr">Bazaar</a>, <a href="svn">Subversion</a>, and <a href="darcs">Darcs</a> installed on your system.

    <p>The tarball contains the minimum set of packages needed to get repo-install working. The bootstrap packages (like all repo-install packages) are actually software repositories. Patches to these systems (including repo-install) can be submitted according to conventions for the given system.

      <h2>To Do</h2>
      Ordered by priority.
      <ul>
	<li>Automatically run regression tests on update (for packages that have regression tests).
	<li>implement 'darcs trackdown' across all repository types.
	<li>Code to automatically submit patches.
	<li>Able to specify a tag or a branch on the upstream repository
	<li>Make it easy to publish your local patches to others.
	<li>Change tarball backed repositories to git
	<li>Test git rebase
